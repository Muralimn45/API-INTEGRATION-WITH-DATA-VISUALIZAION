# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION
using python to fetch data from public API and creating visuals using matplotlib and displaying the live data visuals in webpage
"DESCRPTION":
The first step in creating live data visuals is fetching the data itself. Python's requests library is the standard for making HTTP requests to APIs. You would typically use a GET request to retrieve data from a public API endpoint. Once the data is received, it usually comes in a JSON format. The requests library automatically handles parsing this into a Python dictionary, making it easy to extract the relevant information you need for your visualization.

For data visualization, matplotlib is a powerful and flexible library. It allows you to create a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive plots. The core concept involves creating a figure (plt.figure()) and one or more axes (fig.add_subplot()) to plot your data. You can then use methods like plt.plot() for line charts or plt.bar() for bar charts to represent your data visually. Customizing your plot with titles, labels, colors, and styles is straightforward and allows you to create professional-looking charts.

To display these visuals on a webpage, a simple Python script alone isn't enough to make the visuals "live." A web server is required to serve the webpage and dynamically update the plot. A common approach is to have a server-side script (e.g., using a framework like Flask or Django) that periodically fetches new data, generates a new plot image, and saves it to a specific file on the server. The webpage, which is served by the same server, contains an <img> tag pointing to that image file. To make it feel "live," you can use a small amount of JavaScript to periodically refresh the image without reloading the entire page.

The immersive documents below provide a working Python script and a corresponding HTML file. The Python script demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API, process it, and create a matplotlib plot saved as a PNG file. The HTML file shows how to embed this image on a simple webpage. This is a foundational approach that you can build upon. You could schedule the Python script to run every few minutes to create a new plot, and the webpage would automatically display the updated visual. This method is effective for displaying data that doesn't need to be updated in real-time but rather on a consistent schedule.

This setup provides a great starting point for building more complex dashboards and data-driven applications. You can extend this by exploring different types of plots in matplotlib, using other visualization libraries like Seaborn or Plotly, and integrating your Python script with a full-fledged web framework for more advanced functionality.
